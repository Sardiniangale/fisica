Thermal Conductivity tests.


-Desc of setup

"Two rods, one of silver and another of bronze, with a individual wire going into both."

-Tools used

A thermometer and a ruler (Unceirtanties will be disscussed later on).


-Things we have to measure


-X (The distance between 0 and the point where the temp is measured), measured in CM with a resolution of 0.1 cm (Uncertainty 0.05cm)
-T (The temperature of the hole, at point X), measured in degrees, deg C with a resolution 0.02 c (Uncertainty of 0.006c)

DATA gathered can be found in the ODS document in the file.


//TODO, finish the graphs and the python code :)
